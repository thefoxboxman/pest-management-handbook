Urban pest management is a complex task. Technicians have to balance the client needs, wants and expectation, with the client's ability or willingness to pay. Technicians also consider the safety of the client, the general public and the environment,  the sensitivity and condition of the situation and the requirements of the control measures.

The application of more pesticide, more frequently into a difficult situation is bound to fail either in terms of pest population control or in terms of human health and safety or both.

Integrated pest management involves changing the situation to reduce the dependence on and to increase the effectiveness of chemical control methods.

For example, it is much more cost effective and safer for the occupants to physically exclude a pest rather than treat when infested.

Be warned however, integrated pest management will require technicians who are more skilled and knowledgeable. It may be initially more expensive or difficult to implement for the client, however in the long term it will always be easier for the technician, less expensive and safer for the client and more profitable for the industry.

The Golden Rule: KNOW THY PEST.

Down the ages the great conquerors were successful because they had superior knowledge of their enemy.

Pest control is war. The aim of the battle is to destroy the pest with least impact on the people. The scorched earth approach is no longer acceptable.

The fundamental basis of integrated pest management (IPM) is a sound and thorough knowledge of the pest species' biology and habits. This knowledge is vital in the development of an effective pest management program because it allows the technician to identify the vulnerable aspects of the pest species and suggest modification to the situation which will reduce the pest's ability to survive.

Identification of the pest to at least Genus level and preferably species, is critical for effective pest management. If you don't know your target, what chance do you have of hitting it? One well timed, accurately aimed shot will always be more cost effective and successful than a volley of unfocused, random shots.
