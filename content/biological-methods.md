At this point of time biological control methods for use in urban pest control are quite limited. Biological methods involve the use of one biological organism to limit the population of another. The use of the Cactoblastis Moth to control prickly pear which had heavily infested vast areas of Australia, was perhaps the world's most successful example in biological pest management.

The aim in developing biological control is to isolate a predator or parasite of a pest species which can be bred up and then released into the pest's population. However in doing so the developers must also ensure that the biological agents will not create another problem by spreading to humans or escaping and multiplying in the general environment. We don't want another Cane Toad type biological control disaster.

Vectobac 6AS which contains the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis is now available for biological control of mosquito larvae in all states

There are several other biological agents being developed for urban pest control application. CSIRO for example is investigating the use of a fungi for the control of subterranean termites while a biological agent for use in cockroach baits was recently released in the USA.
