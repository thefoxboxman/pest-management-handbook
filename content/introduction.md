One definition of a pest is, any organism which causes a person discomfort or worry. Many organisms that are classified as pests in the urban environment belong to Class Insects (Insect) and Class Arachnid (spiders, ticks and mites). However many other organisms such as plants, fungi and vertebrate animals are often considered as pest species depending on the situation and the individual. In fact, one person's pest may be another person's pet.

Urban pest management involves many more factors other than just pests and pesticides. It is the "People Factor" however, that makes urban pest management unique. The "People Factor" involves not only clients but also, depending on the situation, the client's family, friends, employees, neighbours and/or the general public.

The Australian urban pest management industry although relatively small, has an enormous responsibility to protect, maintain and enhance the health and well being of the nation's human population, their possessions, and our environment.

Organisms become pests for people because, amongst other things, they can cause damage to buildings (eg termites), spread disease (eg cockroaches), damage belongings (eg silverfish), spoil food (eg weevils), cause discomfort (bird mites), annoy pets (fleas) or are just plain pesky (eg ants).

It is often impossible to eliminate a pest species from the home, office or factory situation. In these cases pest control becomes pest management. The technician's objective is to maintain the pest species population below a threshold level at which it is no longer a concern for the client.

With increasing concern throughout the community with respect to health and safety issues associated with pesticide use, it is becoming more important that technicians implement integrated pest management strategies. Integrated pest management involves the use of a range of treatment methods which may include a combination of chemical and/or non-chemical options.

These emerging fundamental and inevitable changes in the industry and in the way we treat; it requires the technician to be educated, caring, client orientated, well trained, well equipped and well informed.

The industry and the community have undervalued the PCO Urban Pest technician's knowledge and advice for too long. The philosophy has often been NO SPRAY - NO PAY. Spraying is no longer the primary service of the pest control industry; knowledge, information and advice is now the main service. The philosophy has become LESS SPRAY - MORE PAY.

For too long the pest control industry establishment has resisted change and has defended the old ways, aided and abetted by clients' lack of knowledge. The public is much more informed, all be it often misinformed, but they are aware and demand to be involved in the decision making process.

Pest control used to be something a client had done. Pest management is now something they do - in conjunction with their technician.

The purpose of this handbook is to update and report emerging technologies and trends and to provide product information to assist technicians and their clients to select the most appropriate treatment strategy for the pest problem.
