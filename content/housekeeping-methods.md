Housekeeping applies equally to homes, shops, offices and factories. It involves the management or organisation of practices that prevent or restrict the entry, survival and/or breeding of pests.

Housekeeping methods are generally  routine client activities such as cleaning, checking stock on arrival for pests, building maintenance programs, storage practices, hygiene and sanitation.

Housekeeping is an absolutely vital part of any IPM program and it will ultimately determine the degree of pest population control achieved. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear - nor can a technician be successful where housekeeping is poor.

Good housekeeping makes the pest control technician's job more effective and efficient. The cost savings can be shared by both the client and the technician.

IPM requires the full co-operation of the client to ensure success, especially with respect to good housekeeping. It is the pest control technician's role to consult with, and advise the client on the good housekeeping practices necessary for their particular situation.

The range of options available for enhancing housekeeping practices are extensive. Each situation will require its own unique selection of practices. The technician needs to be comprehensive, bold and imaginative in the development of a housekeeping improvement proposal.

Unfortunately much of the housekeeping activity is beyond the control of the technician. The technician must therefore rely heavily on developing a rapport with the client, to ensure the client's commitment to high standards of  housekeeping. The technician must also be "up-front" with the housekeeping assessment and consultation, otherwise the client could perceive the emphasis on "poor" housekeeping practices as an excuse for substandard control of the pests.
