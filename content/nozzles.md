Nozzle selection is greatly underrated by many technicians in the urban pest control industry.

Nozzles are highly engineered pieces of equipment. They are designed to fine tolerance to deliver a given volume of liquid, in a particular pattern, and the droplets in a particular size spectrum. The use of wire, pins or needles to clean blocked nozzles , can in an instant destroy these predetermined characteristics.

These characteristics will also change as the nozzle wears. Nozzle orifices, particularly those of commonly used brass nozzles, wear in the course of use. This wearing is pronounced when wettable powder formulations are being used.

Nozzle selection is particularly important in treating surfaces where area distribution is essential, such as carpet treatment for fleas. Flat fan nozzles are preferred since they provide even distribution of spray across the spray pattern. Hollow cone nozzles apply more to the centre and are designed to be used in overlapping combination, to achieve even distribution.

Neither flat fan or hollow cone nozzles will be effective in applying pesticides to cracks and crevices as they both rely on air movement to carry the droplets to the target. Since very little air moves into cracks and crevices as the nozzles pass by, very few droplets will be deposited into the cracks and crevices either. Therefore a crack and crevice nozzle which provides a pin stream, is the recommended nozzle of choice.

Nozzle selection is not difficult, but is important. The following points need to be considered when choosing a nozzle for a job:

(1) The target (e.g. fleas, cockroaches etc).

(2) The situation (e.g. carpet, cupboard interior)

(3) The application volume required.

(4) The most appropriate droplet size.

Since with most application equipment, the operating pressure is to a large degree fixed, nozzle orifice size should be varied to vary droplet size and application volume. Remember, the smaller the orifice size, the lower the volume applied. This produces smaller droplets and a greater coverage at a given pressure.
