<main><h1>14. Glossary of Terms</h1><p><strong>Absorption:</strong> Is the process by which one substance is taken into another substance. For example as water is taken up by a sponge.</p>

<p><strong>Active constituent (ac)</strong> - see active ingredient.</p>

<p><strong>Active ingredient (ai):</strong> That part or proportion of the pesticide which is responsible for the effect on the target pest.</p>

<p><strong>Acute oral LD50:</strong> Is the dose administered by mouth (oral) required to kill 50 per cent of the animal under test. Most commonly expressed for male rats but may be done for many species.</p>

<p><strong>Acute toxicity:</strong> Effect of pesticide or chemical substance that occurs immediately or directly upon exposure to the substance. Usually refers to one exposure time frame.</p>

<p><strong>Adsorption:</strong> Is the process by which one substance adheres to the surface of another substance in a very thin layer.</p>

<p><strong>Biocide:</strong> A chemical pesticide that is toxic to a wide range of species.</p>

<p><strong>Biological control:</strong> The regulation of plant and animal populations by natural enemies. The term is also applied to the practice of using natural enemies to manage pest populations.</p>

<p><strong>Carcinogenic:</strong> Is the ability of a substance to promote cancer.</p>

<p><strong>Carrier:</strong> Any substance, may be liquid solid or gas and is usually inert, which is mixed with the active ingredient to assist application. Usually used to reduce concentration to user strength.</p>

<p><strong>Chemical:</strong> Most substances in the universe.</p>

<p><strong>Chemical name:</strong> Scientific name for the active ingredient in a pesticide</p>

<p><strong>Chronic toxicity:</strong> Effects of pesticide or chemical substance that occur as a result of repeated exposure to sub-acute toxicity doses. Long-term health effects associated with repeated exposure.</p>

<p><strong>Compound:</strong> A substance composed of two or more chemicals.</p>

<p><strong>Contact pesticide:</strong> Is a product which affects the pest when the pest is directly exposed to the product. Contact pesticide is usually skin absorbed.</p>

<p><strong>Dermal toxicity:</strong> The toxicity of a chemical associated with skin application and/or absorption.</p>

<p><strong>Desiccant:</strong> Is a substance which promotes the loss of water. Some products contain desiccants to improve pesticidial activity.</p>

<p><strong>Diluents:</strong> Any substance, liquid, solid or gas used to dilute technical grade active ingredient during product formulation to reduce concentration to user strength.</p>

<p><strong>Dose:</strong> The amount of chemical or pesticide active ingredient administered to, or absorbed by the target.</p>

<p><strong>Drift:</strong> Pesticide that moves out of the treatment zone or is off target.</p>

<p><strong>Emulsifier:</strong> Any substance that allows two liquids to mix (eg oil and water) which would not normally mix. Emulsifiers are used to form emulsifiable concentrate formulations of oil based insecticides which can be mixed with water for application.</p>

<p><strong>Emulsion:</strong> Is the result of mixing two liquids which do not normally mix , usually with the assistance of an emulsifier. Emulsions are tiny droplets of one liquid suspended in the other liquid.</p>

<p><strong>Formulation:</strong> Is the form of the product, after manufacture, which is purchased for use. Examples of different formulations include wettable powder, dusts and emulsifiable concentrates. Formulation may also refer to the actual process of manufacturing a pesticide.</p>

<p><strong>Frass:</strong> The refuse or excrement left by organisms.</p>

<p><strong>Genus:</strong> Is a group of closely related species the first name in the scientific name. eg Coptotermes, Nasutitermes and Schedorhinotermes</p>

<p><strong>Inert Ingredient:</strong> Is any substance in the pesticide formulation of spray mixture which has no pesticide activity.</p>

<p><strong>Integrated Pest Management:</strong> A strategy that utilizes knowledge, action criteria, materials and methods in a co-ordinated program to manage pest populations.</p>

<p><strong>Instar:</strong> Is the stage of insects between successive moults. The first instar being the stage between eggs hatching and the first moult.</p>

<p><strong>Larvae:</strong> Is the immature stage of an insect between egg and pupal stages associated with complete metamorphosis.</p>

<p><strong>Moult:</strong> The process of shedding the exoskeleton. This is also known as ecdysis.</p>

<p><strong>Mutagenic:</strong> Is the ability of a substance to produce genetic changes in living cells and organisms</p>

<p><strong>Nymph:</strong> Is an immature stage following hatching of an insect that does not have a pupal stage. Associated with incomplete metamorphoses.</p>

<p><strong>Pathogen:</strong> A micro-organism that lives and feeds on or in a larger host and thereby injures the host, often resulting in the hosts death.</p>

<p><strong>Pesticide resistance:</strong> Genetically selected tolerance or immunity of pest population to pesticides. Often as a result of the populations repeated exposure to sub-lethal doses of a particular pesticide.</p>

<p><strong>Pest management:</strong> The manipulation of pest or potential pests populations so as to diminish or render the pest of no concern to the client (ie is below the clientï¿½s tolerance level).</p>

<p><strong>pH:</strong> Is a measure of acidity or alkalinity.</p>

<p><strong>Pheromone:</strong> Is a substance produced by an organism that stimulates one or more behaviours of other organisms of the same species. Pheromone sex attractant are used by many insects to ensure male and female can find a mate.</p>

<p><strong>Phytotoxicity:</strong> Is the ability of a product to damage plants.</p>

<p><strong>Predator:</strong> An organism that feeds upon other organisms (prey) that are either smaller or weaker than themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Residual pesticides:</strong> Are products that remain capable of killing or affecting their target pest which contacts the treated surfaces long after application.</p>

<p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Is the ability of an organism to overcome the effect of the pesticide either partially or completely.</p>

<p><strong>Scientific name:</strong> Is an internationally recognised name given to organisms. Scientific names are usually bi-normal (ie two parts) made up of the Genus name followed by the species name, eg Coptotermes acinaciformis.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Is a mixture on one or more substances in another substance.</p>

<p><strong>Species:</strong> Is a group of similar organisms with the ability to interbreed and produce fertile offspring.</p>

<p><strong>Sub-species:</strong> Is a sub-group of a species sometimes referred to as a race.</p>

<p><strong>Surfactant:</strong> Is a substance which reduces the surface tension of droplets, which allows the spray to stick and spread more efficiently. Surfactants are also referred to as wetting agents, spreader and sticker.</p>

<p><strong>Suspension:</strong> Is a mixture containing small particles (solid or liquid) which are dispersed in the carrier liquid or gas but which are not dissolved in the carrier.</p>

<p><strong>Synergism:</strong> Is the combined effect of two or more active ingredients on the target pest which is greater then the sum of the effects of each active ingredient activity on its own.</p>

<p><strong>Synergist:</strong> Is a substance which improves the effectiveness of an active ingredient. Pipernoyl butoxide is a synergist commonly used to increase the effectiveness of natural pyrethroid insecticides.</p>

<p><strong>Technical grade material:</strong> Is the pure form of the active ingredient prior to formulation.</p>

<p><strong>Wetting agent - see surfactant</strong></p>
